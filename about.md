I am currently a Computer Science Master student in Artificial Intelligence at the prestigious University of St Andrews. I'm fascinated by Deep Learning and I am looking to devote myself to the advance of Machine Learning technology to improve and foster the progress of humankind.

I'm currently looking for a Ph.D. advisor to continue my research in Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Networks, and self-learning agents.
