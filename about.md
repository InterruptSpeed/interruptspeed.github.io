I am currently a Computer Science Master student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of St Andrews. I believe that there is great potential for intelligent machines to improve our lives and the world we live in through the understanding of irreducibly complex systems. In my current work, I focus on understanding current state-of-the-art Machine Learning technology, as well as, specific elements from other fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and statistics. 

I'm currently looking for a Ph.D. advisor to continue my research in Deep Learning, self-learning agents, and intelligent systems.
